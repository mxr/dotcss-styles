# dotcss-styles

My custom css for use with [dotcss](https://github.com/stewart/dotcss)

I've separated this from my dotfiles since it is a bunch of noisy css,
most of which I did not write.

## Usage

Clone this into the directory that `dcssd` serves files from.
Run `./compile.sh` to update some of the files.
